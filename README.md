### SMS Spam Classifier Project

**Description:**
This project focuses on building an SMS spam classifier to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. It involves:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data distribution and patterns.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Converting text into numerical features through tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.
4. **Model Building**: Training machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) to classify messages.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. **Improvement**: Refining the model based on evaluation results.
7. **Website Creation & Deployment**: Planned for future development; current focus is on data and model work.

**Disclaimer**: This project is for practice purposes and heavily relies on online resources for guidance and implementation.
